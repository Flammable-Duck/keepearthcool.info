One major reason for what makes Earth so unique is its ability to
support life, which is in large part due to the greenhouse effect. Life
is dependent on energy, which, at the base natural level, arises from
the sun. This energy heats the earth, passing through our atmosphere and
heating our planet, while energy is re-radiated outward, which either
leaves the atmosphere, or is captured by greenhouse gasses in the
atmosphere. A certain amount of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is
essential; this prevents the earth from becoming too cold. However, in
our case now, an overabundance of greenhouse gasses is trapping excess
heat in the atmosphere, excessively warming our planet. This is known as
the greenhouse effect.
