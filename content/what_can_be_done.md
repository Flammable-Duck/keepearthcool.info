Now that you're educated, you may be asking, what can be
done to help? The following is a list of what can be done on the
individual level, to the local, and global stage.

-   Organizations like the EPA are ensuring everyone from individuals
    to industry are falling in line with emission standards.
-   From the private sector, leaps in solar, wind and geothermal energy
    provide cleaner, healthier options to fossil fuels.
-   The investment in carbon capture is enabling us to capture carbon,
    directly from the atmosphere.
-   Take a

    test to observe what effect
    your lifestyle has on the planet:
-   Cut back on water, air conditioning and heater use.
-   Take public transportation, bike, or carpool, as opposed to
    driving.
-   Advocate in your local communities for community environmentally
    friendly policies.
-   Advocate to your state and federal representatives that climate
    change is a major issue for you.
-   Bring awareness to climate change, whether through social media, or
    word of mouth.
-   Reduce your food waste, and think sustainably when you shop, reuse
    items.
