Climate Change broadly refers to major shifts in
temperature and weather, which may be natural, or human originated.
However, since the 19th century, human driven industrialization and
energy demands have been the largest contributor to climate change.
Evidence of Climate Change can be seen in changing temperature and rain
patterns, increase in ocean temperature, acidity, and rise in sea level,
melting of permafrost and ice sheets, as well as great shifts in
ecosystems around the world.
