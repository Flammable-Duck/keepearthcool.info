Having come to this point, you may be wondering, Why
should I care? The following list contains reasons that it is not only
important, but essential to handle this issue before it comes to
late.

If not addressed, earth is predicted to rise up to 3 degrees in
temperature. This would mean:

-   Deadlier heat waves, wildfires, freak weather events, acidic
    rain.
-   Hotter and more acidic oceans, leading to a massive decline in sea
    population.
-   A quarter of Earth's total species may go extinct.
-   Massive reshaping of world coasts, leading to places such as Rhode
    Island, San Miami, Bangkok and entire island countries underwater.
-   12% of current human population would face devastation

-   The longevity and survival of our species depends on the safety of
    our planet.
-   This is our only planet, and we must ensure, in order to prosper,
    we take care of our home.
-   The potential for a cleaner, more sustainable and happier future.
