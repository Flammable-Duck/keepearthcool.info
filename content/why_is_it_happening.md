While massive shifts in climate have occurred in the
past, such as the Roman warm period and the little Ice Age, these events
only occurred on a regional scale, as opposed to the global effects of
climate change seen today. Along with this, the last natural major shift
in Earth's climate occurred over 2,000 years ago. Instead, over the past
two hundred years, starting with industrialization in the 1800's,
indications our climate has been changing have arisen, only this time,
with examination of the amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, it
is clear that this is human originated.

While the previous section covered in detail how earth's
climate, specifically the greenhouse effect, functions to support life,
the reality is that a balance is necessary to ensure that Earth's
climate doesn't become too cold, or too hot. Without becoming too
complex, the main cause of our warming climate currently is an influx of
greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere, beyond an acceptable level. Like
discussed in the previous section, the greenhouse effect is necessary to
ensure Earth can support life, however the burning and consumption of
gasses such as Carbon Dioxide, Methane, and Nitrous Oxide have led to an
overbalance of greenhouse gasses, leading to a global warming effect and
climate change. According to NASA, temperature has increased for
an average of 1.01 degrees worldwide, which may not seem like much, but
in reality has devastating consequences for natural environments,
ecosystems, and how we live.
